# Note 1: 
#   Create the confusion matrix. Rows represent actual loan status; columns 
#   represent predicted loan status. The diagonal entries represent correct 
#   predictions. 

# Note 2: 
#   Overall model accuracy. 73% of the predictions were 
#   correct. 

# Note 3: 
#   Model precision: 76% of the applicants predicted as 
#   bad really did default. 

# Note 4: 
#   Model recall: The model found 14% of the defaulting 
#   loans. 

# Note 5: 
#   False positive rate: 2% of the good applicants were 
#   mistakenly identified as bad.
