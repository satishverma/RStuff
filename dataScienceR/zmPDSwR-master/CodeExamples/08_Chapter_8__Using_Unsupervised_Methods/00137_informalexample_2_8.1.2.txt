vars.to.use <- colnames(protein)[-1]       	# Note: 1 

pmatrix <- scale(protein[,vars.to.use])    	# Note: 2 
pcenter <- attr(pmatrix, "scaled:center")  	# Note: 3 
pscale <- attr(pmatrix, "scaled:scale")
                                        

# Note 1: 
#   Use all the columns except the first 
#   (Country) 

# Note 2: 
#   The output of scale() is a matrix. For the 
#   purposes of this chapter, you can think of a matrix as a data frame with 
#   all numeric columns (this isn't strictly true, but it's close enough).  

# Note 3: 
#   The scale() function annotates its output with 
#   two attributes: scaled:center returns the mean values of all the 
#   columns; scaled:scale returns the standard deviations. We will store 
#   these away so we can "unscale" the data later.
