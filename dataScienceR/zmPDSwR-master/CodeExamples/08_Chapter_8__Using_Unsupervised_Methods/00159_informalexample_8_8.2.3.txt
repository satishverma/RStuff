# Note 1: 
#   Call apriori() with a 
#   mimimum support of 0.002 and a minimum confidence of 
#   0.75. 

# Note 2: 
#   The summary of the apriori() 
#   output reports the number of rules found... 

# Note 3: 
#   ... the distribution of rule lengths. In 
#   this example, most rules contain 3 items (2 on the left hand side X 
#   (lhs) and one on the right hand side Y (rhs))... 

# Note 4: 
#   ...A summary of rule quality measures, 
#   including support and confidence... 

# Note 5: 
#   ...and some information on how 
#   apriori() was called.
