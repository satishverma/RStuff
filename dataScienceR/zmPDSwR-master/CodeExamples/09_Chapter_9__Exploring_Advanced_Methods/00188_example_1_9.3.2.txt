# Note 1: 
#   Split data into test and training 

# Note 2: 
#   Ask that the linear regression model we are 
#   building be "stepwise" improved, which is a powerful automated procedure for 
#   removing variables that don't seem to have significant impacts (can improve 
#   generalization performance). 

# Note 3: 
#   Build the basic linear regression model. 

# Note 4: 
#   Define the root mean square error 
#   function. 

# Note 5: 
#   Calculate the root mean square error between the 
#   prediction and the actuals.
