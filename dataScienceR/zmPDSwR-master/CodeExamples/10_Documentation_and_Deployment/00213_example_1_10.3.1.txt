#    Return the pseudo logarithm of x, which is close to
# sign(x)*log10(abs(x)) for x such that abs(x) is large
# and doesn't "blow up" near zero.  Useful
# for transforming wide-range variables that may be negative
# (like profit/loss).

#    NB: This transform has the undesirable property of making most
# signed distributions appear bimodal around the origin, no matter
# what the underlying distribution really looks like.
# The argument x is assumed be numeric and can be a vector.
