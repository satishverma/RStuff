# Note 1: 
#   The null model has (number of data points - 1) 
#   degrees of freedom 

# Note 2: 
#   The fitted model has (number of data points - 
#   number of coefficients) degrees of freedom 

# Note 3: 
#   Compute the difference in deviances and the 
#   difference in degrees of freedom 

# Note 4: 
#   Estimate the probability of seeing the observed 
#   difference in deviances under the null model (the p-value) using a 
#   chi-squared distribution.
