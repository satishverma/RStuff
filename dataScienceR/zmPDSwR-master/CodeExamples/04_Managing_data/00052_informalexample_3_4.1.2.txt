# Note 1: 
#   Select the age ranges of interest. The upper and 
#   lower bounds should encompass the full range of the data.  

# Note 2: 
#   Cut the data into age ranges. The include.lowest=T 
#   argument makes sure that zero age data is included in the lowest age 
#   range category. By default it would be excluded.  

# Note 3: 
#    The output of cut() is a factor variable.
